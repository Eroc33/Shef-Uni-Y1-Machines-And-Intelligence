Two "implement the blanks" assignments for a first year module ("machines and intelligence").


#WordLatticeAssignment16

In WordLatticeAssignment16 the implemented parts are the `LatticeSearch` and `LatticeState` classes, and these are called from the (lecturer supplied) main method in `RunLatticeSearch`. Most of the rest of the code was provided by the lecturer.

#RuleNets_ProjectPt1

RuleNets_ProjectPt1 implements a rule based deduction system.

In RuleNets_ProjectPt1 the only implemented part is `RuleNet::propagate`
